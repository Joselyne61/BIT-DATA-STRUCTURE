# Assignment-one This Python script demonstrates basic data handling and control structures using visitor check-in data:

📊 Visitor Statistics: It calculates the total, average, minimum, and maximum number of visitors using a list of integers.(integer)

📝 Formatted Report: A clean report is generated using f-strings, showing the session statistics and a summary line that includes both totals and averages.(string)

✅ Conditional Logic: A threshold check determines whether the session performance is "Above Standard" or "Below Standard", using a compound Boolean condition.(boolean)

📋 List Manipulation:

A list of visitor names is created and modified.

A new name is added ("Frank"), and any name starting with "C" is removed.

Finally, the list is sorted alphabetically.
